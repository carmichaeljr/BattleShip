# BattleShip
This is the very first program I wrote that did something. As a result, my knowledge of code was limited to contidional statements. No funcitons, no objects, no design patterns.
This is probably the worst code that someone could possibly write. I am still astounded I got it to work with the limited knowledge I had.

The program works as expected when run: you play battleship against the computer.
Be carefull, the computer is quite a good oponent(sometimes).
